                            <h3>MONKEYS</h3>
    <p>Monkeys live in trees, grasslands, mountains, forests, and on high plains. A group of monkeys is called a troop.
         Most primates share six basic features: forward-facing eyes, eye sockets, grasping hands, nails, fingerprints, and large brains.
         Monkeys are most easily distinguished from apes by their tails.</p>
     <p>Here are some adjectives for monkey: kinda hairless, whiskered, gray, remarkable and altogether extraordinary, underdeveloped, hairless, african green, mild-mannered golden,
          golden playful, worthy and well-educated, big, solitary, cynical but observant, hairless gray, ately smart, sad, unappeasable, vast, perky, small ...</p>
   <p>All monkeys have fur, but it can be lots of different colors, usually brown or black. Almost all monkeys have tails, and this is how you can tell they are monkeys and not apes. Apes do not have tails!
        The pygmy marmoset is the smallest monkey, and it is only 4-6 inches tall and weighs less than half a pound.</p>
   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>Monkeys tend to inhabit the tropical rainforests of Africa, Central America, South America and Asia.
         All primates live in trees, with the exception of baboons that prefer to live on the ground.</p>
