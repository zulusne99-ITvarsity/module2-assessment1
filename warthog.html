                            <h3>WARTHOGS</h3>
    <p>Like their relatives, warthogs are plump, hooved animals with large nostrils at the end of the snout.
         They have little fur, except for a mane that goes down the spine to the middle of the back, according to the Animal Diversity Web (ADW).
         Their tails also end with a tuft of hair. They have large teeth or tusks.</p>
     <p>Warthogs are members of the same family as domestic pigs, but present a much different appearance. 
         These sturdy hogs are not among the world's most aesthetically pleasing animals—their large, flat heads are covered with "warts," which are actually protective bumps. Warthogs also sport four sharp tusks.</p>
   <p>With their self-discipline and strength of character, they are formidable business adversaries. They reward loyalty but have a vindictive streak for those who cross swords with them. Their tempers often overcome their good judgment.</p>
   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>Habitat. Common warthogs live in the grasslands and savanna woodlands of Africa. They prefer open areas, and are found on Mount Kilimanjaro at an elevation of 3,000 meters (9,843 feet), according to ADW.
         Desert warthogs are found in eastern Africa — in parts of Kenya, Somalia and Ethiopia.</p>
