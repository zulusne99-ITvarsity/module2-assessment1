                            <h3>GIRAFFE</h3>
    <p>They have long legs, long necks, and relatively short bodies. Their heads are topped with bony horns, and their tails are tipped with a tuft of fur.
         A short mane runs down the length of their long necks, and their coat is covered with a blotched/blocky pattern.</p>
     <p>Giraffes are the world's tallest mammals, thanks to their towering legs and long necks. A giraffe's legs alone are taller than many humansâ€”about 6 feet .
          These long legs allow giraffes to run as fast as 35 miles an hour over short distances and cruise comfortably at 10 miles an hour over longer distances.</p>
   <p>What do giraffes look like? The long legs and necks of giraffes make them tallest of all the mammals; at around six foot, the legs alone are taller than many humans.
        They have a distinct spotted coat, with no two giraffes having the exact same pattern.</p>
   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>Most giraffes live in grasslands and open woodlands in East Africa, especially in reserves such as the Serengeti National Park and the Amboseli National Park.
       Some are also found in the reserves of Southern Afric.</p>
