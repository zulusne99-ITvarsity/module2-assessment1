                            <h3>LIONS</h3>
    <p>Lions have strong, compact bodies and powerful forelegs, teeth and jaws for pulling down and killing prey. Their coats are yellow-gold, and adult males have shaggy manes that range in color from blond to reddish-brown to black.
         The length and color of a lion's mane is likely determined by age, genetics and hormones.</p>
     <p>Lions are the only cats that live in groups. A group, or pride, can be up to 30 lions, depending on how much food and water is available. Female lions are the main hunters.
          While they're out looking for food, the males guard the pride's territory and their young.</p>
   <p>The lion is a well-muscled cat with a long body, large head, and short legs. Size and appearance vary considerably between the sexes.
        The male's outstanding characteristic is his mane, which varies between different individuals and populations.</p>
   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>Nearly all wild lions live in Africa, below the Sahara Desert, but one small population exists around Gir Forest National Park in western India.
         Lions in west and central Africa are more closely related to these Asiatic lions in India, than to those found in southern and east Africa.</p>
