                            <h3>PANDAS</h3>
    <p>Giant pandas have a distinctive black and white coat, with black fur around their eyes and on their ears, muzzle, legs and shoulders.
         ... Adult pandas are about 150cm from nose to rump, with a 10-15cm tail. And they can grow up to 90cm tall at the shoulder.</p>
     <p>Giant Pandas are known around the world for their unique black and white appearance. They resemble other bears in their shape, but have very distinctive markings. All Giant Pandas have black patches around their eyes and black ears on a white head.
          Their legs are black and there is a black band across their backs.</p>
   <p>A behavioural neuroscientist called Edgar E. Coons thinks that humans find pandas so cute because of the "hedonic mechanisms" their features set off in us.
        ... The way giant pandas tumble about reminds us of toddlers even though they are slightly larger than most toddlers (well, at least out of the ones I've met).</p>
   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>In the wild, giant pandas are only found in the remote, mountainous regions of central China, in Sichuan, Shaanxi and Gansu provinces, according to the National Zoo. 
        In this area, between 5,000 and 10,000 feet elevation (1,524 - 3,048 m), are the cool, wet bamboo forests that giant panda's call home.</p>
