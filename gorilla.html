                            <h3>GORILLA</h3>
    <p>Western gorillas are exceptionally large and powerful primates. They have no tails and jet black skin. 
        Facial features include short muzzles, a prominent brow ridge, large nostrils, and small eyes and ears. Western gorillas have large jaw muscles and broad, strong teeth..</p>
     <p>The gorilla's coat color is black. Short, thin, gray-black to brown-black hair covers the entire body except the face. Western lowland gorillas may have a more brownish coloration.
          A small white tuft of hair on their rump distinguishes infants up to four years old.</p>
   <p>Sociable gorillas are characterized by a high desire to interact with other gorillas, and show high levels of sympathy, affection and gentleness.
        Those who scored high on proto-agreeableness (similar to human agreeableness) are friendly, emotional stable and content – the “oases” of calm and peace.</p>
   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>Eastern gorillas live in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Uganda and Rwanda.
         Whereas western gorillas can be found in Nigeria, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Republic of Congo, Angola and DRC.</p>
