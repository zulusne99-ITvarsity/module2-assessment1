                            <h3>KOALA</h3>
    <p>Koalas are well-known for their large round head, big furry ears and big black nose.
         Their fur is usually grey-brown in colour with white fur on the chest, inner arms, ears and bottom. They have no fur on their nose or the palms of their paws.
         ... Koalas have poor vision and rely heavily on their other senses.</p>
     <p>Koalas have special physical characteristics that complement their tree-dwelling lifestyle. With two opposable digits, their forepaws are well-adapted to gripping branches and picking eucalyptus leaves, their main form of nourishment.
          ... Koalas also have special adaptations that enable them to feast on eucalyptus leaves.</p>
   <p>It is easily recognisable by its stout, tailless body and large head with round, fluffy ears and large, spoon-shaped nose. 
       The koala has a body length of 60–85 cm (24–33 in) and weighs 4–15 kg (9–33 lb)..</p>
   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>Koalas live in the eucalyptus forests of southeastern and eastern Australia.
        When not sleeping, they're usually eating. They rely on the eucalyptus tree for both habitat and food..</p>
