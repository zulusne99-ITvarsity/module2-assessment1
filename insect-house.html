                            <p>An insect hotel, also known as a bug hotel or insect house, is a manmade structure created to provide shelter for insects.
                                 They can come in a variety of shapes and sizes depending on the specific purpose or specific insect it is catered to.</p>
                              <p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND IT?</strong></p>
                              <p>The best place to put an insect hotel is a sheltered area out of the wind around 5-8 feet off of the ground.
                                   Keep bug hotels in a place out of reach of dogs and cats and in an area that gets morning sun to prevent mold.</p>
